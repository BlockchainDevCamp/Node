# Launching

In order to launch the `Node` server you would need to execute the following command in the command line:
```
npm start
```

Environment could be specified when launching the server as well:
```
NODE_ENV=<ENVIRONMENT_NAME> npm start 
```
where `<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` should be the value of the corresponding environment on which the server would be ran, e.g. `development`.
